            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm nearly 30 years old and have spent most of my working life as a Duty Manager in Retail.
                Throughout that time, I have gained a National Certificate in Art & Animation, A HND in Software Development
                and now I am finishing my 4th year BSc in Computer Science. 
            </p>
        </p> My goal is to graduate with a junior role and get exposed to many areas of an organisation to upskill my ability,
        skills and knowledge to encompass a multi-displinary mindset to ensure I am operating as a highly versatile member of any
        organisation I am a part of. 
    </p>
    So far in my education, I feel as though I am pivoting towards the Cloud Architectural & DevOps roles. Conversely, my long term
    personal ambition is to develop my own solo indie video game, so I really am open to learning as much as I can in the professional domain
    to ensure I have the required skillset to endeavour this personal milestone. For example, I have just been introduced to C++ and Scala - this
    is obviously invaluable for video game development.
